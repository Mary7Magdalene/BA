**Fungal Back Acne Prediction using Machine Learning**
This project aims to predict the occurrence of fungal back acne based on various environmental and personal conditions. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes factors such as lifestyle, skin type, hygiene habits, and climate to determine the likelihood of developing the infection.
**Dataset**
The dataset consists of records with multiple features related to an individual's health, skin condition, and environmental factors. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of fungal back acne.
